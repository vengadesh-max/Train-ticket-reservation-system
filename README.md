# Train ticket reservation system

### Project Description
The Railway Reservation System is a Python-based application allowing users to book and cancel train tickets via a command-line interface. It leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, supports different compartment classes, tracks seat availability, handles payments, and generates booking codes.

### Key Features
##### Booking Tickets: 
Users can book tickets by selecting a compartment and completing the payment process.
##### Canceling Tickets: 
Users can cancel their bookings using a unique coupon code and receive a refund based on their ticket status.
##### Data Persistence: 
Booking details are stored in a CSV file, allowing for easy management and retrieval of booking information.
##### Seat Management: 
The system tracks the availability of seats across different compartment classes.
##### Refund Calculation: 
Automatically calculates refunds based on ticket status (confirmed or waiting list).

### Technologies Used
##### Python : Main programming language for application logic.
##### CSV Module: For data storage and management of booking details.
##### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): To ensure a modular design and separation of concerns.
